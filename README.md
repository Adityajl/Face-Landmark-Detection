Have you ever thought how Snapchat manage to apply amazing filters according to your face? It have been programmed to detect some marks on your face to project a filter according to those marks. In Machine Learning those marks are known as Face Landmarks. In this notebook I will guide you how you can detect face Landmarks with Machine Learning.
